COVID-19 pneumonia and the subsequent risk of acquiring pulmonary tuberculosis: A population-based dynamic cohort study using national insurance claims databases

The dataframe could not identify any person and could not be traced back. Only necessary variables were retained. Raw data can be shared upon written request to the corresponding author.
